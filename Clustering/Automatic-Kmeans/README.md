# Chapter 9 Problem 9.10
## Implementation of K-Means with Automatically K Selection

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problem 9.10 in Chapter 9. A K-Means algorithm with automatically k selection for classification problem is implemented. The main steps are as follows:

1. Iterating through the range of possible K and calculating the sum of distance from each point to its centroid 
2. Selecting the the turning point, k, whose slope changing a lot.


For instance, in the following graph, the turning point is k = 3:
