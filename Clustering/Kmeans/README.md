# Chapter 9 Problem 9.4 
## Implementation of K-Means

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problem 9.4 in Chapter 9. A K-Means algorithm for classification problem is implemented. The main steps are as follows:

1. Initilizing n centroids 
2. Splitting the data into the cluster of its nearest centroids
3. Updating the new centroids after 1 round clustering of all data
4. Repeating step 2 and 3, until the clusters constant
