# Chapter 3 Implementation of Linear Model

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problems in Chapter 3. Several linear classification models were built on different algorithms and details are as follows:

- Problem 3.3: [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Hatchin/Machine-Learning-Zhou_Zhihua/tree/master/Linear/LogisticRegression)
- Problem 3.5: [Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA)](https://github.com/Hatchin/Machine-Learning-Zhou_Zhihua/tree/master/Linear/LDA)
