# Chapter 6 Implementation of Support Vector Machine

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problems in Chapter 7. Several Bayes Classifiers were built.

- Problem 7.3: [Naïve Bayes Classifier using Laplacian Correction](https://github.com/Hatchin/Machine-Learning-Zhou_Zhihua/blob/master/Chap7/Problem7.3/)
- Problem 7.6: [Semi-Naïve Bayes Classifier - Averaged One-Denpendent Estimator (AODE)](https://github.com/Hatchin/Machine-Learning-Zhou_Zhihua/blob/master/Chap7/Problem7.6/)
