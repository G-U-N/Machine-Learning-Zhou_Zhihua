# Chapter 7 Problem 7.3 
## Implementation of Naïve Bayes Classifier using Laplacian Correction

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problem 7.3 in Chapter 7. A Naïve Bayes Classifier using Laplacian Correction is implemented. The main steps are as follows:

1. Prior probabiltiy compution using Laplacian Correction
2. Conditional probability compution using Laplacian Correction
3. Computing cumulative product of probability for each class
4. Return the class with the largest Probability
