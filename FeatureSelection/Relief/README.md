# Chapter 11 Problem 11.1 
## Implementation of Relief Algorithm

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problem 11.1 in Chapter 11. A relief algorithm for binary classification problem is implemented. The main steps are as follows:

1. Data Pre-Processing: One-Hot Encoding and Min Max Rescaling
2. Computing the nearest samples of each row for the same and opposite classes
3. Computing the delta value for each features
4. Selecting the features with its delta larger than threshold
