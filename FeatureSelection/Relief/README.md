# Chapter 10 Problem 10.1 
## Implementation of K Nearest Neighbors

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problem 10.1 in Chapter 10. A K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification problem is implemented. The main steps are as follows:

1. Selecting the k nearest training samples of the testing sample   
2. Classifying the test sample as the most common class among the k nearest samples
