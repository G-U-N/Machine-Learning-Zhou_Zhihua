# Chapter 8 Problem 8.5
## Implementation of Bagging for Decision Stamps

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for problem 8.5 in Chapter 8. An Ensemble Classifier using Bagging is implemented. The main steps are as follows:

1. Generating a sub-sample from training dataset
2. Calculating a decision stamp on the sub-sample
3. Repeating Step 1 and 2, until T decision stamps are generated
4. Returning the T decision stamps
