# Chapter 4 Problem 4.3 
## Implementation of ID3 Algorithm

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for Problem 4.3 in Chapter 4. A decision tree was built on ID3 algorithm. 
The major steps involved in the implementation are as follows:

1. Entropy Calculation
2. Information Gain Calculation
3. Best Attribute Selection
4. Subdata splitted
5. Decision Tree Building

The basic algorithm explaination and example code could be found:
- [ID3 Algorithm in Steps](https://machinelearningforbeginners.wordpress.com/2017/11/23/id3-algorithm-implementation-in-python/)
- [Decision Tree in Python](https://www.python-course.eu/Decision_Trees.php)

Based on the example code, the feature of dealing with numeric value is added to the new model.
