# Chapter 4 Problem 4.4 
## Implementation of CART Algorithm with Pruning

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for Problem 4.4 in Chapter 4. A decision tree was built on CART algorithm and pruning option is added.
The major steps are as follows:

1. Gini Calculation
2. Gini Index Calculation
3. Best Attribute Selection
4. Subdata splitted
5. Decision Tree Building with Pre-pruning
6. Post-pruning for a Fully Grown Tree

The basic algorithm explaination and example code could be found:
- [CART Algorithm and Pruning in Steps](https://blog.csdn.net/HerosOfEarth/article/details/52425952) (in Chinese)

Based on the example code, the feature of dealing with numeric value is added to the new model.
