# Chapter 5 Problem 5.5 
## Implementation of Back-Propagation

This repository contains my personal notes and codes for Problem 5.5 in Chapter 5. Standard and accumulated back-propagation algorithms were implemented. The main steps were as follows:

0. Dummies variables
1. Initialize Network
2. Forward Propagation - Compute the output of a network
  - Neuron Activation.
  - Neuron Transfer.
  - Forward Propagation.
